# Simplified Script Execution System - Requirements (Enhanced)

## Introduction

This specification defines enhanced requirements for implementing a production-ready simplified script execution system that clearly separates built-in scripts from user-defined scripts. The system addresses critical issues identified in the current implementation including placeholder SSH integration, insufficient parameter validation, incomplete error handling, missing frontend functionality, and lack of comprehensive testing.

The solution maintains KISS principles while ensuring production readiness through robust error handling, comprehensive validation, proper SSH integration, complete frontend implementation, and extensive testing coverage.

## Requirements

### 1. Production-Ready SSH Context Integration
**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want built-in scripts to properly integrate with existing SSH connection management, so that scripts execute reliably in production environments without placeholder implementations.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1.1. When built-in scripts execute, then they SHALL use real SSH connections from the existing connection pool
1.2. When `createCommandContext()` is called, then it SHALL return a fully initialized CommandContext with active SSH connections
1.3. When SSH connections are established, then connection parameters SHALL be validated before script execution
1.4. When SSH connections fail, then the system SHALL retry with exponential backoff up to 3 attempts
1.5. When SSH connections timeout, then the system SHALL terminate gracefully with clear error messages
1.6. When SSH connections are pooled, then connection reuse SHALL be managed to prevent resource leaks

### 2. Comprehensive Parameter Validation Framework
**User Story:** As a developer, I want a robust parameter validation framework that handles all edge cases, so that dynamic scripts receive properly validated input and execution failures are prevented.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
2.1. When parameters are collected, then the system SHALL validate type, format, range, and required field constraints
2.2. When parameter validation fails, then specific field errors SHALL be returned with actionable error messages
2.3. When parameters have dependencies, then cross-field validation SHALL be performed before execution
2.4. When parameters contain special characters, then they SHALL be properly sanitized to prevent injection attacks
2.5. When parameters are missing default values, then the system SHALL prompt for required input or fail gracefully
2.6. When parameter validation succeeds, then validated parameters SHALL be passed to scripts in a type-safe manner

### 3. Enhanced Error Handling and Recovery
**User Story:** As a user, I want comprehensive error handling with recovery mechanisms, so that script failures provide clear guidance and the system remains stable.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
3.1. When script execution fails, then error messages SHALL include specific failure reasons, context, and suggested recovery actions
3.2. When SSH connections are lost during execution, then the system SHALL attempt to reconnect and resume or fail gracefully
3.3. When script execution times out, then the system SHALL terminate the process cleanly and release resources
3.4. When validation errors occur, then the system SHALL return structured error responses with field-specific details
3.5. When system errors occur, then they SHALL be logged with correlation IDs for debugging and monitoring
3.6. When critical failures happen, then the system SHALL maintain stability and continue serving other requests

### 4. Complete Frontend Parameter Collection Implementation
**User Story:** As a user, I want a fully functional parameter collection interface, so that I can provide script parameters through an intuitive and responsive UI.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
4.1. When dynamic scripts are selected, then the frontend SHALL display appropriate input controls for each parameter type
4.2. When parameter forms are submitted, then client-side validation SHALL provide immediate feedback
4.3. When parameter validation fails on the server, then error messages SHALL be displayed next to relevant form fields
4.4. When parameters have dependencies, then the frontend SHALL update dependent fields dynamically
4.5. When parameter forms are complex, then they SHALL provide help text, examples, and validation hints
4.6. When forms are submitted, then loading states SHALL be shown and double-submission SHALL be prevented

### 5. Built-in Script Type Management (Enhanced)
**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want built-in scripts to be managed purely in code with production-ready implementations, so that the system maintains clean separation and reliable execution.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
5.1. When built-in scripts are defined, then they SHALL include comprehensive metadata, validation rules, and error handling
5.2. When built-in scripts are registered, then registration SHALL include health checks and dependency validation
5.3. When built-in scripts execute, then they SHALL use real SSH connections and proper resource management
5.4. When built-in scripts fail, then failures SHALL be logged with sufficient detail for production debugging
5.5. When built-in scripts complete, then resources SHALL be properly cleaned up to prevent memory leaks

### 6. Static Built-in Script Execution (Enhanced)
**User Story:** As a user, I want static built-in scripts to execute reliably with proper monitoring, so that diagnostic scripts provide accurate results quickly.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
6.1. When static scripts execute, then they SHALL complete within 30 seconds or timeout with clear error messages
6.2. When static scripts run, then execution progress SHALL be reported to users in real-time
6.3. When static scripts fail, then partial results SHALL be preserved and displayed where applicable
6.4. When static scripts complete, then results SHALL be formatted consistently and include execution metadata
6.5. When static scripts encounter system issues, then fallback mechanisms SHALL provide alternative information

### 7. Dynamic Built-in Script Execution (Enhanced)
**User Story:** As a user, I want dynamic built-in scripts to handle parameters robustly with comprehensive validation, so that complex installations complete successfully.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
7.1. When dynamic scripts receive parameters, then comprehensive validation SHALL occur before execution begins
7.2. When parameter validation fails, then users SHALL receive specific guidance on correcting invalid inputs
7.3. When dynamic scripts execute, then progress reporting SHALL include current step, estimated completion, and any warnings
7.4. When dynamic scripts encounter errors, then recovery mechanisms SHALL attempt to continue or rollback safely
7.5. When dynamic scripts complete, then success confirmation SHALL include installation details and next steps

### 8. Comprehensive Testing Framework
**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive unit and integration tests, so that all script execution strategies are validated and production issues are prevented.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
8.1. When strategy implementations are created, then unit tests SHALL cover all execution paths and error conditions
8.2. When SSH integration is implemented, then mock and real SSH connection tests SHALL validate proper functionality
8.3. When parameter validation is added, then tests SHALL cover edge cases, invalid inputs, and boundary conditions
8.4. When error handling is implemented, then tests SHALL verify proper error messages and recovery mechanisms
8.5. When frontend integration is completed, then end-to-end tests SHALL validate complete user workflows
8.6. When performance requirements are set, then load tests SHALL verify execution times and resource usage

### 9. Performance and Resource Management
**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the script execution system to manage resources efficiently, so that it remains responsive under load and prevents resource exhaustion.

9.1. When scripts execute concurrently, then the system SHALL limit concurrent executions to prevent resource exhaustion
9.2. When SSH connections are used, then connection pooling SHALL optimize resource usage and prevent connection leaks
9.3. When scripts run for extended periods, then timeout mechanisms SHALL prevent runaway processes
9.4. When memory usage grows, then garbage collection SHALL be triggered and memory leaks SHALL be prevented
9.5. When system resources are low, then new script executions SHALL be queued or rejected gracefully

### 10. Monitoring and Observability
