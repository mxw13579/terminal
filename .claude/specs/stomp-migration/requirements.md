# SSH Terminal STOMP Migration Requirements

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for migrating the existing SSH terminal WebSocket architecture from native WebSocket to STOMP (Simple Text Oriented Messaging Protocol) over WebSocket. The current system provides SSH terminal access, SFTP file operations, and system monitoring capabilities through a custom message routing system. The migration aims to leverage Spring Boot's built-in STOMP support for improved maintainability, scalability, and developer experience while preserving all existing functionality.
